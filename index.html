                <p>Hi there! My name is Ricson B. Escalicas. I am a virtual assistant from Cebu, Philippines. I believe that "how you do anything is how you do everything," so I always strive to do my best.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I focus on <span class="about-me-highlights">improving myself</span> through my:

                        <li class="basis"><span class="about-me-highlights">Mission</span> (My Deemed Purpose In Life)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    These are collectively known as my <span class="about-me-highlights">Basis</span>, which defines who I am. With <span class="about-me-highlights"></span>clear goals in mind, I plan what I want to do and work on those plans every day!
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>While the future is unpredictable, it's clear that the <span class="about-me-highlights">consistent steps</span> we take now can lead us forward, with God's help. I hope to achieve most, if not all, of my goals by acting consistently and following through on my commitments to myself.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I am a results-driven professional with more than two years of experience in <span class="professional-highlights">various roles</span>. I specialize in providing customized support to meet my clients' specific goals and challenges.</p>
                <br />
                <p><span class="professional-highlights">My skills</span> include leadership, teamwork, and creating a positive team atmosphere that leads to great results. I excel at adapting to changing situations and achieving excellent outcomes.</p>
                <br />
                <p>My career has given me the ability to succeed in different roles while maintaining professionalism and attention to detail. I am eager to use my diverse skills and strong dedication to help the team, <span class="professional-highlights">contribute</span> to the organization's success, and <span class="professional-highlights">ensure</span> excellent customer satisfaction.</p>

                </div>

                <p>I am someone who constantly seeks knowledge and <span class="hobbies-highlights">enjoys</span> learning. I often engage in <span class="hobbies-highlights">self-study</span> to improve myself, especially outside of work, focusing on my long-term goals. Researching, analyzing, and gaining new insights is mentally stimulating and rewarding. It gives me a sense of <span class="hobbies-highlights">accomplishment</span> as I work toward my goals one step at a time.</p>
                <br />
                <p>My interests include web development, languages (currently Spanish and Portuguese), self-defense/bodybuilding, first aid, and finances. I regularly review my weekly progress to ensure I stay aligned with my goals and avoid drifting off track. This helps me stay <span class="hobbies-highlights">focused</span> on achieving my objectives.</p>

                        <br />
                        <p>I always position the value of the service wherein it has an audio service in the radio, plus streaming services. In addition to that, I always gave my clients promotional rates. By getting such services on a promotional rate, most of them will definitely consider it as <span class="sales-highlights">"a steal"</span> and would just dive right in.</p>
