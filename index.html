                </div>

                <p>Hi there! My name is Ricson B. Escalicas. I'm a virtual assistant from Cebu, Philippines. I believe in a saying that "How you do anything is how you do everything." I always <span class="about-me-highlights">do my best</span> in everything that I do. </p>
                <br />
                <p>I work on <span class="about-me-highlights">improving myself</span> along with my: 
                    <br /> 
                    <ul>
                        <li class="basis"><span class="about-me-highlights">Core Values</span> (My Character)</li>
                        <li class="basis"><span class="about-me-highlights">Vision</span> (The Man I Envsion To Be)</li>
                        <li class="basis"><span class="about-me-highlights">Mission</span> (My Deemed Purpose In Life)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    They're collectively known as the <span class="about-me-highlights">Basis</span> or just simply who I am as a person. With these <span class="about-me-highlights">clear goals</span> in mind, I plan the things that I want to do and work on those plans every day!
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>Although the future in itself is unpredictable, it's becoming apparent through the <span class="about-me-highlights">consistent steps</span> we take at the present moment, if God willing. I hope that one day, I'd be able to reach most if not all of my goals, so long as I act consistently and do the things I said to myself. </p>

                <p>I'm a person that always <span class="hobbies-highlights">seek knowledge</span> and I'm interested to it. So, I usually do some <span class="hobbies-highlights">self-studies</span> to improve myself especially outside of work.

The process of researching, analyzing, and gaining new insights are mentally <span class="hobbies-highlights"></span>stimulating and <span class="hobbies-highlights">rewarding</span>. This gives me a sense of accomplishment knowing that I'm working on my goals one at a time.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The things that fit my <span class="hobbies-highlights">interests</span> are web' dev', languages (currently Spanish and Portuguese), computer networking, fighting (self-defense), first aid, finances, etc. I also review my <span class="hobbies-highlights">weekly progress</span> to see if I'm still <span class="hobbies-highlights">align</span> with my goals or I'm slowing swaying away. In such way, I'd be ensure that I'm still working on my <span class="hobbies-highlights">goals</span> as much as possible.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for visiting. I hope you enjoyed your stay here.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>I'd like to venture more into the VA world and that's why I created this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I want to showcase the services, skill set, and the value that I can provide to my potential clients.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>You can go ahead and contact me for work, collaboration, or just saying hi. I look forward into it. </p>
